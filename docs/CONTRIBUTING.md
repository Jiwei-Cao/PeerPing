## Development Rules — Keep the App Compilable
- Every commit/PR must result in an app that **boots in Expo without errors**.  
- Do not import files that don’t exist.  
- If a feature isn’t ready, create a **placeholder component (stub)** so imports resolve.  
- Keep `App.tsx` minimal and always runnable.  
- Add new libraries with `expo install`, not plain `npm install`.  
- Don’t leave unused Babel plugins or config references.  
- Run `npx expo start -c` locally before pushing to confirm the app compiles.  
- Think about maintainability and scalability while making any edits.
- Make sure to read the whole codebase before making any changes.
- Write concise, meaningful comments that explain why the code exists or any non-obvious decisions, and avoid restating what the code already clearly does.
- Build and test smaller, independent components first before integrating them into larger features to keep development stable and easier to debug.
